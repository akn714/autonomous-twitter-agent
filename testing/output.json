    "p∞nam parihar": "Apple’s latest research shows AI “reasoning” models like Claude and  DeepSeek-R1 crumble on complex tasks—they memorize patterns but can’t  truly reason or adapt. Genuine AGI will need much more than just bigger  models. \n@bandarlogdev #thefeedbackloop #ai #LLMs https://t.co/PRvGm0sU9y",
